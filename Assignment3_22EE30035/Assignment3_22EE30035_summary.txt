Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.

According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. Nothing came of this search either. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. The name of the child is unknown.

(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. "The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from," Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered.

Affleck explained, "I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth." Whatever the results of the review, Affleck and Gates did the right thing. In fact, as Affleck noted, much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled. Instead, Gates simply noted that Affleck  "asked us to edit out something." That would have made the information truly newsworthy. Affleck has noted that he regrets asking PBS to not include information about his "distant relative." That's a nice gesture, but it was not needed. Affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show. And PBS had the choice to include it or leave it out.

For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure.

Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese. But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'. Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories, including providing: . The survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff. Sixty-three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination, if the disability needs of obese workers were not met. Yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water, Ms Sunderland warned.

Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in New York. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first. Children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way. Electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions. Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt. Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work, according to a neuroscientist . Of course, there's nothing new about that: human brains have been changing, adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries.

Ibrahimovic, pictured celebrating with Marquinhos, will be convinced that PSG can progress against Barca . Against Barcelona, Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . Ibrahimovic made his point by scoring for Paris in Barcelona in a group game earlier this season. But this is the big one. Nobody will give him a chance – except for Zlatan himself.

(CNN)You know the phrase "dodging a bullet"? Forget about it. Probably not going to happen anymore. The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In the tests, an experienced marksman "repeatedly hit moving and evading targets," a DARPA statement said. In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.

Vladimir Putin is planning to exploit the threat of nuclear war to force Nato out of countries bordering Russia, it has been claimed. Threat: Vladimir Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region . Notes from the top secret meeting between American and Russian officials in Germany last month have reportedly been seen by The Times. Meanwhile, Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukraine in the hope of defeating pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border. 'The Russian people would demand a forceful response [to such advances]', the Kremlin intelligence chiefs reportedly added. Unveiled at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Moscow, the brand is called The Army of Russia. 'Polite' is a phrase used by Russians to justify their takeover of Crimea last year. It refers to pro-Moscow forces' apparently 'polite' requests for the dramatically outnumbered Ukrainian security personal to leave the region.

But the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped Australia asunder. Australia's participation in the war was contested from the outset. Australian and New Zealand women had a unique advantage in shaping public debate: the vote. Goldstein's early entreaties failed to bite with the general populace. Around the nation, trade unionists opposed to "the capitalist war" joined the movement. Anti-conscription demonstrations saw up to 100,000 people gather on the dusty banks of dirty brown Yarra River.

Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them  for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes.

Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . ‘There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks.

Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy, generating over 60% of our carbon-free electricity. Well, think again. Despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free, the Obama administration's energy policy plan is biased against it. This bias is created by how Environmental Protection Agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation. EPA's modeling is divorced from reality. In other words, EPA assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050. The students demonstrated that under this scenario, EPA's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase. President Obama's EPA has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model. EPA's modeling of the 2009 Waxman-Markey bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation. Where did this policy shift come from? The administration also believes in man-driven global warming, which should make nuclear energy its golden key. If you think this administration supports nuclear energy, think again.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world, is ready for action following a two-year shutdown. "Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN's here for," CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer said on the organization's website. "Today, CERN's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC." At near light-speed, a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the "Big Bang" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. By replicating the energy density and temperature, scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved. Our current, limited, knowledge is based on what's called The Standard Model of particle physics. CERN says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown. Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.

Scientists believe life on Earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago. Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago. Scroll down for video . Scientists believe life on Earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago, but they are still far from knowing how it appeared. It also acts as an on-and-off switch for some genes. The researchers believe these fragments used their innate self-evolving abilities to grow into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life. Many origin-of-life researchers say that RNA chains are too specialised to have been created as a product of random chemical reactions. The new study, however, claims to provide an alternative theory by arguing primordial DNA-like fragments evolved in this way instead. The researchers found the self-assembly of DNA fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds. These connect together short DNA chains to form long ones, without the need for a separate biological process.

Summary:
That's partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a "moment." So what makes now different? The loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system. How do we face this crisis? First, we must recognize that there are no quick fixes. The culture of policing in cities such as New York and Baltimore has developed over decades. To subvert that culture will require vigorous, targeted and consistent training. And it's true that his options are limited. By conditioning federal funds on compliance with federal standards. That must change. Much has been made of rogue police officers, "bad apples" and other aberrant actors in the criminal justice system. They undoubtedly exist. There must be zero tolerance for racism, brutality and corruption in police departments. Hamm is right -- policing is, at its core, a service profession. A national crisis requires a national response, and that means that federal, state and local law enforcement leaders and organizations must honestly and aggressively move to end police brutality.

Harris ran when officers came in for the arrest. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, told CNN that he is pleased District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler pressed charges. That manpower should have been enough to arrest him, he said. "It was a situation where I didn't necessarily think that a Taser should even be used," Andre Harris said. Scott Wood, another Bates' attorney, has said the shooting was an "excusable homicide." The sheriff's office has said that Bates had law enforcement certification, but Smolen said he has not seen any field training records. "We're holding up all right at this point," Andre Harris said.

Researchers have found a similar pattern in two apparently unrelated places - skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in the Namibian desert. Desert fairy circles are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because no one knows how they form. The experts found that the results were almost identical, in that both the majority of skin cells and fairy circles had six neighbours. ‘I didn't expect it to be so close,’ Professor Sinclair said. The researchers suspect the patterns might be similar because both skin cells and fairy circles are fighting for space. There is a no vegetation growth within the circular area . The genesis of a fairy circle has not been observed. The scientists simulated underground competition for water and the spatial vegetation distribution patterns. They found that similar patterns emerged on the screen to those recorded in Namibia.

Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The Late Jurassic dinosaur lived 145 million years ago. It has a small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. It has leaf-shaped teeth, similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs. They discovered that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod the Velociraptor. Chilesaurus represents one of the most extreme cases of evolutionary convergence. Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. Here, a palaeontologist painstakingly excavates the fossils . ‘Chilesaurus was an odd plant-eating dinosaur only to be found in Chile. The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years. Researchers examined over 1,500 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their family tree.

The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck. Suddenly, the vehicle backs up, knocking Sloan to the ground. Carter later died. Knight was only defending himself against Sloan, whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time. "Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor," Knight's attorney argued. Fletcher added that Knight's defense was to stand his ground. Sloan "needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor," Fletcher said. "There was pre-mediation and intent when he (Knight) ran over him a second time." Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30.

President Barack Obama told MSNBC that the United States has been clear in its messages to Tehran on sending weapons to Houthi rebels inside Yemen. They are not there to intercept Iranian ships," State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters Tuesday. There is a message for Iran as well. At this stage, there are nine U.S. naval ships operating off the coast in Yemen. Kevin Stephens of the Fifth Fleet told CNN. Sayyari added that Iranian navy ships in the area were there to combat piracy and secure the safe transfer of goods through the waters.

The fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children. Like the wider Syrian conflict, Yarmouk has a human face; the faces of young Mohammad and young Jihad. Jihad Ya'qoub, the youngest Palestinian refugee to flee Yarmouk, was born on March 30. His mother, Said Fatima, never imagined bringing a child into this world could be so tough. Mohammad was born in Yarmouk on January 25 of this year. Her only thoughts were to save the life of her newborn son. Yet she has not lost hope in the possibility of a dignified future. To do this, hostilities will have to subside. Pressure must be exerted on armed actors in Yarmouk to this end. These things are all possible. But it takes the necessary political will -- nothing more, nothing less. Yarmouk must be a place where the politics of the possible begin to take hold. I believe they can. Because to abandon such belief would be to abandon Jihad, Mohammad and thousands of other civilians like them. And that is simply not an option.

A boatload of 900 migrants who embarked from Libya are now feared dead in the latest sinking. Over 10,000 were rescued off the coast of Italy in the last week alone. European leaders are scrambling to deal with this emergency. There is a backstory here worthy of our attention, and it has to do with Italy's colonial past. It also affects the treatment of Africans who settle in Italy. Libya is an example of the long reach of Italian imperialism. In 1970, soon after he took power, Gadhafi struck back, expelling the remaining Italian community in Libya. Some of those people had grown up entirely in Libya. They arrived in Italy for the first time, at some of the same ports receiving migrants today. Italian rescuers and activists work tirelessly and selflessly, and yet migrants who remain in Italy are often subject to racist attacks. The Italian government deserves the full support of the European Union as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis. But it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past.

But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican. He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate. The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less. Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record. The American people deserve better than Rand Paul.

Let us address some of these: . That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress. But that is not and never was the objective. The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal. Another dubious assumption of opponents is that the Iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program. This of course is not the case. While the United States has played a leading role in the effort, it negotiated the terms alongside its partners. Again, this is not the case. This provision will be permanent. It does not sunset. But the issue is not suited for a treaty. Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories. For example, the New START treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads. But any agreement with Iran will not be so balanced. The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran. To include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill. Those judgments should be fact-based, not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions.

"Justice has been served today," Donahue tweeted. Survivor Karen Brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal. Dzhokhar, in her view, was "all in." You can't call it celebration.

Or, like Indiana Gov. The federal law was intended to protect individual's religious freedom from government intervention, he said. The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom, he contends. Other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- Indiana became the 20th. But other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the Indiana law does. This was in New Mexico, a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute. What would happen if that case happened today in Indiana, with the new, expanded religious freedom law? They lost the case. Holbrook said. According to Blackman, the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform. And then, there is the Hobby Lobby case. For that matter, there is also no federal law that protects the LGBT community. With the proliferation of religious freedom state laws, nondiscrimination laws become even more important. If New Mexico had the same religious freedom law as Indiana, the case would have gone to trial.

For the first time, astronomers have found the building blocks of life  in a distant early star system. Scientists detected the complex organic molecules in a disc of gas around an infant star 455 light years away where planets are likely to be forming. The discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on Earth are not unique to our solar system . Radio telescope observations showed the disk surrounding the million-year-old star MWC 480 to be 'brimming' with the complex carbon-based molecule methyl cyanide. Experts believe comets and asteroids from the outer solar system seeded the young Earth with water and organic molecules to set the stage for life to evolve. Alma's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive, but thrive . 'We are not talking about little green men,' Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' The molecules surrounding MWC 480 have been detected in similar concentrations in our own solar system's comets, she pointed out.

That was until one night when they heard a strange man's voice come over the monitor to tell their son: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you.' They believe the stranger has also got into the camera on the device. Technology experts have now warned that it is becoming easier for hackers to infiltrate family's baby monitors as many of the newer devices connect to the internet. Because some new baby monitors connect to the internet and come with a smartphone app, it has become easier for hackers to infiltrate them and listen in or speak to children .

Scroll down for video . Negotiators announced a framework deal on Thursday. The deal is scheduled to be finalized by June 30. In defending the framework and a potential final pact, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the framework as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. He is urging negotiators to improve the agreement or scuttle it. Other Republicans have echoed Netanyahu's concerns. In the meantime, economic and financial sanctions would stay in place. 'Is there a better deal to be had? I think so,' Graham said on CBS' 'Face The Nation.' Feinstein said imposing more and stiffer economic sanctions would only drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground and make it more difficult to monitor.

German air traffic control officials today called for technology that ground staff could use in an emergency to take remote command of a plane. Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month. Investigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane into a French mountainside on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. Pilots associations are sceptical of the plans, with German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit saying the idea of remote control from the ground could be open to abuse. Tribute: Flowers in front of the monument in homage to the victims of the Germanwings flight in Le Vernet . A spokesman said: ‘We also have to ask whether such a solution would really be an improvement. Cyber-security experts said onboard firewalls intended to protect aircraft electronics from hackers could be breached if flight control and entertainment systems use the same wiring and routers. Politicians in Congress called on the FAA to act.

They have developed a new device, Comfortably Numb, to ease the pain of an injection. Scroll down for video . 'Our device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water, ' Mr Hua said. 'We then numb the skin by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin.' The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. It costs around $2 (£1.34) to produce, they said . A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. The skin can then be numbed by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin. Within 60 seconds the patient's skin is numb and they can have an injection without experiencing pain. 'That's the kind of amazing thing about our project,' Mr Allison said. I think that's what drew us to this specific project,' Mr Allison said.

'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. It wasn't. It was a time of great advances for working people,' he has said. It ain't going to happen,' he declared. 'Unite is supporting Labour 100 per cent,' he said, adding that is now campaigning 'all over the country'. Yet there was something synthetic about McCluskey's protestations of support for Labour. No one would give me any information. Did you fit a tracking device to Len's car?' For this is no small-town demagogue. On the contrary, McCluskey is pivotal to Labour's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party. Since 2010, Unite is estimated to have donated at least £14.4million to Labour's coffers. In addition, 133 Labour candidates at this election are reported to have links to Unite.

Sweden's passport was among the most frequently sold travel documents on the black market . Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. Swedes pay just £28 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn’t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world – behind Sweden, Finland and Germany – with a fee of £73. In Liberia, it would take a worker earning minimum wage 278 hours to pay off the country's £33 passport. And it appears travellers around the world would love to get their hands on a UK passport.

Tottenham are considering a state-of-the-art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new NFL London franchise. Tottenham are considering sharing their new £400m stadium with an NFL franchise . The NFL is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in London. Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.’

Chimpanzees crossing a busy road in Kibale National Park in Uganda (above) have learned to look for traffic . It is the first time chimpanzees have been seen to change their behaviour to adapt to busy roads. Chimpanzees appear to flavour their food with herbs, researchers have suggested. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. 'Chimpanzees crossed in small subgroups. Whole parties crossed more rapidly when chimpanzees were more numerous in the crossing groups.' The researchers said they saw several different primates killed on the roads in the past year. They watched 122 chimps cross the road over the course of two and half years. They found most of the chimps looked for traffic before crossing and as they crossed. Adult chimps, like this one, tended to wait for younger chimps to cross and checked they got over safely . Females with young and injured adults tended to cross less frequently. Chimps have been noticed to cross in similar ways on other non-asphalted roads.

It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of Mrs Alexander’s family. A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge (pictured) has finally come to and end after 35 years . Then, 23 years ago, single mother Mrs Alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour Jeanette Robinson to trim the hedge. But her council has ruled that Mrs Robinson can keep the hedge, although it has to be cut to 20ft. Mrs Alexander said the ruling made ‘no difference’. The High Hedge Act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden. The local authority cannot make any orders about the roots of the hedge. Mrs Alexander’s only option is the courts which she cannot afford to do. Over the years she had used the mediation services of Stirling District Council to try to resolve the issue. The council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft, a height which Ms Alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight .

The baby boom generation is set to leave one last burden to its children and grandchildren – a wave of funeral debt. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: ‘More than half of UK households have less than £3,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, it found. An average ‘full works’ funeral now costs £5,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.

Tokyo (CNN)A second robotic probe sent into the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has captured images of a strange green glow. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an "unprecedented" experiment.

According to scientists, sugar consumption can suppress the hormone cortisol, which is released into the body when we are experiencing stress. Researchers in the US examined the effects of sweetened drinks on 19 women aged between 18 and 40. Half the group were given sugary drinks at breakfast, lunch and dinner over 12 days, while the other half had drinks made with the artificial sweetener aspartame. The volunteers were instructed not to consume other sugary drinks, including fruit juice, outside these times. Saliva samples were also used to measure levels of cortisol, which is made by the adrenal glands. The women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks. Around half of the American population consume sugary drinks on any given day. Dr Laugero added: ‘The results suggest differences in dietary habits may explain why some people under-react to stressful situations and others over-react. ‘Although it may be tempting to suppress feelings of stress, a normal reaction to stress is important to good health.’

(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Under the new "no jab, no pay" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. "It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations.

The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter from last year. She added that artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the sun care market. And Sandra Vaughan, a beauty consultant for artificial tan brand Fake Bake, said the pale look is now more fashionable. But even the TOWIE crew themselves admit the look can easily go wrong. She said: ‘Just before Christmas I overdid it with the fake tan. I made my legs too dark and I just thought, what have I done? Even the programme itself has ridiculed the dangers of fake tan. 'It’s like fake tan has been off the air for a while.’ Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow. The weather has also played a part, she said. ‘If skin is not on show, why dress it up?’

The findings come after the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said he was dubious about using technology as a teaching aid in non-IT classes. However, research into the effects of the devices on literacy levels suggests the best outcome comes from youngsters sharing devices. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users. She worked with 352 students at a Midwestern suburban school district during the research.

Amid a pulsating and sometimes controversial cup tie, the hosts ultimately had no answer to Italian international Mantellato, whose last three tries came within the space of seven decisive minutes. Winger Josh Mantellato scored four tries and kicked 14 points for Hull KR against Bradford Bulls . The Bulls struck again when O'Brien and Etu Uaisele put Dale Ferguson over, although Shaw got a fortuitous bounce off the upright in adding the extras this time. Rovers bounced back, capitalising on an unforced error from Shaw to halve the early deficit when winger Mantellato dived over in the corner then converted his own try. Mantellato's kick bounced back off of the upright and Bradford nearly responded when Uaisele crossed but the final pass was deemed forward. Three minutes later Lucas Walshaw crashed over after innovative work from Paul Clough, Addy and Gaskell and Shaw edged Bradford back in front. But three tries, all from Mantellato, in seven minutes finally quashed the brave Bulls' hopes of an upset. Mantellato struck once more before John Boudebza helped raise the half century for Rovers on the hooter.

Post-war economic development in the fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. The book also explores momentous periods which truly characterised Italian fashion. Another poignant moment came in the mid-Fifties, where Italian fashion began to break away from what Parisian style dictated. From that moment on, styles quickly progressed. A model is pictured in Italy in 1953. In the mid-forties, Italian designers began to take their inspiration from Hollywood femme fatales rather than Parisian fashion. Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones . Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer - her designs were on several occasions interpreted by Christian Dior . In fact, Parisian fashion soon began to follow the lead of Italian innovators. A piece from Italian designer Federico Forquet, in his autumn/winter 1965 collection . From then on, it seemed that Italian fashion was the pinnacle of daring style. Co-author of the book, Enrico Quinto says that Italian glamour is 'in the DNA of an Italian's lifestyle'. Italian style is very much still crucial to the fashion landscape .

Summary:
A new study has shown women still have an increased risk of breast cancer years after stopping taking hormone replacement therapy . After going through the menopause a woman's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen. HRT treats the body by introducing female sex hormones. They enrolled more than 26,000 women aged 50 to 79 in the study. Both concluded that women prescribed HRT were at a higher risk of breast cancer, than those not receiving the treatment. After the reported increased risk in breast cancer for women taking combined HRT, use of the therapy dropped dramatically. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK are the two largest studies into the effects of HRT. In the first two years, after stopping HRT treatment, researchers noted a sharp decrease in breast cancer risk in those women who had taken both oestrogen and progesterone. Even up to five-and-a-half years later, breast cancer risk remained high. But for those women taking oestrogen only treatment, the risk for invasive breast cancer fell. 'It's different for each woman.'

Luna was 16 at the time of the shooting. Lane, an Australian attending East Central University, was jogging when he was shot in the back by a gun fired by Luna.

The vehicle's driver, Michael Jones, pleaded guilty in March to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors dropped first-degree murder charges filed against the third suspect, then only 15, after he agreed to testify against Luna and Jones, according to CNN affiliate KSWO.

Summary:
In fact, the bombing took the country by surprise. The public became aware of the true danger of the extreme right. Law enforcement also played catchup. In contrast, the report spent only a paragraph describing the threat from right-wing extremists. After Oklahoma City, everything changed. The effort actually paid off. Increased scrutiny of right-wing extremists resulted in a flurry of arrests for everything from terrorist plots to hate crimes. Certainly, the 9/11 attacks warranted great attention. They made starkly clear the threat that international radical Islamist groups posed to the United States. Moreover, the surge of right-wing extremism that marked the 1990s had seemingly ebbed. Thus it is no real surprise that concern over right-wing violence faded into the background. But right-wing extremism did not disappear after September 11. It, too, represents a serious threat. In other words, right-wing violence today is actually at or very close to levels during the days of the Oklahoma City bombing. The anger and hate that generated the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 is still around in 2015—and still dangerous.

Brain scans on a group of professional comedians has revealed differences in the way the brains of these 'super speakers' work while talking. Stroke survivors often suffer damage to this area of their brain and struggle to recognise when family and friends are being sarcastic. The findings may also help to explain why some people dry up completely when asked to speak. Dr Devlin and his colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brains of 17 professional comedians, a radio presenter and barrister. They were compared against a control group of students, who, according to Dr Devlin, were far less adept at the task. Super speakers were found to have less activity in Broca's region of the brain, shown in the image above . There's been almost no interest in how speech goes right.' The study revealed that the same areas of the brain were activated when both the comedians and the students were speaking. However, the comedians and other super speakers showed lower levels of activity in an area of the brain known as Broca's region.

Not a single centrifuge is destroyed. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium," Netanyahu said Sunday. "That's a very bad deal.

With less than a month to go before the movie hits theaters, Marvel Studios put all the speculation to rest with a poster featuring Bettany as the heroic android, who was a member of the superhero group for many years in the comics. Not to be outdone, director Bryan Singer announced a new character for next year's sequel "X-Men: Apocalypse," by telling Empire magazine that Ben Hardy would be playing the role of the winged mutant Angel. He even had a photo to share. And he looks ... pretty much like The Thing we already knew (but reportedly, CGI this time). Within 24 hours, we got yet another indication that the superhero trend isn't going anywhere anytime soon (and we didn't even talk about the new photo of Ryan Reynolds' "Deadpool").

Kate Winslet was a vision in blue at a London film premiere this week. Her stunning body-con dress (top) had clearly been made to measure by Stella McCartney. But my, what big feet — and big leopard-print stilettos — she has! At 5 ft 7 in, the 39-year-old Oscar-winner is certainly no towering Amazon, but nonetheless she commands an out-of-the-ordinary UK size-nine shoe. Titanic feet: At 5ft 7in, the 39-year-old Oscar-winning actress, who loves a strappy stiletto, wears a roomy size-nine shoe . She markets her own brand of foot spa — perfect for feet of all sizes, not just Elle’s sizeable twelves. Even at 5 ft 9in, Katie towered over her pint-sized former husband, Tom Cruise. The 36-year-old actress does have large feet for her height - size 8. They certainly look big — and match her large hands. Her size eights  seem large on her 5 ft 7 inframe. At 5 ft 7in, her tiny figure emphasises her shoe size. Uma, 44, is a modest 5 ft 11in.

(CNN)Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. "It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner." As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential.

It even boasted an indoor roller coaster. But despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came. When I visited two years ago, the mall was deserted. Most units were empty. The occupancy rate was less than 10%. It was a walk through a ghost mall. The mall was buzzing with activity. Large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Screams and laughter can be heard from merry-go-rounds. "It's been a big change. "We come here at least once a month now." Despite the signs of life, much of the mall is still vacant. "I'm so excited!" "You must come, my coffee is the best in China!" Today, it no longer feels like a walk through a ghost mall. What's more, the mall's latest re-launch is not its first. But the revamp failed and the mall remained empty. Now, the owners are hoping for third time lucky. PICTURES: Inside a Chinese ghost city .

These zombie stars are thought to be leaving a 'mass grave' of white dwarf stars near the centre of the Milky Way. Scroll down for video . More work needs to be done.' When a star runs out of fuel it usually collapses in on itself. Stars more than eight times the mass of our sun will explode in a supernova, leaving behind a neutron star or black hole. When they peered at the Galactic Centre, they found an emission of X-rays that corresponded to thousands of dead stars being present. But it is the potential for these to be white dwarf stars that is the most intriguing theory. Scientists at Haverford College in Pennsylvania say they have spotted X-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarfs (one illustrated centre) at the galaxy's centre. These are stars left behind after larger ones use up their fuel. But why thousands of these stars are here remains a mystery . Behind is left the hot, dense core which burns white. Other possible explanations include millisecond pulsars, which are rapidly rotating neutron stars .

All of them are adopting or advocating for hiring practices that open up work opportunities for people with convictions and leverage untapped potential in the labor market. "Ban the box" doesn't prohibit background checks, it only postpones them until later in the hiring process. That's one reason the African-American unemployment rate is persistently twice that of whites. These policies are also gaining traction with politicians across the political spectrum. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently signed executive orders removing the conviction question from initial applications for state employment. So far, 16 states and more than 100 cities and counties have adopted fair-chance hiring policies. The administration should ensure that the federal government does not continue to erect unfair and unnecessary barriers to employment of people with records. If Koch Industries -- a major federal contractor -- can ban the box, there's no reason why other federal contractors cannot. Now it's time for President Obama to lead the way and embrace fair-chance hiring of people with records.

I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. Throughout the entire encounter with Scott, it's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him. Would he have fired? Eight times? Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report? Of course not. Body cameras are expensive to deploy, sure. Certainly it's worth the price of some mass data storage. And there's something else at stake. Every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street. As tension rises, the risk of more shootings increases. Police body cameras can help break this cycle. Complaints against cops decrease, and, most importantly, use-of-force incidents drop. I will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution. These may not be overtly racist cops. Set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops. Institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it.

The International Red Cross noted that "many people are expected to throng coastal areas at this time." The storm has weakened and is expected to lose more strength before it reaches the Philippines. Its maximum sustained winds on Wednesday were 150 mph, making it a super typhoon in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's definition. Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera told CNN that Maysak could weaken further to become a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Philippine coast. "This will not be a catastrophic storm," Cabrera said. That said, it could still cause flooding and bring strong winds, he cautioned. The Philippines is frequently hit by typhoons. In December, for instance, Hagupit killed at least 18 people in the East Asian nation and injured hundreds more. That typhoon, considered to be among the strongest storms ever to make landfall, hit the eastern city of Tacloban especially hard. That alert means all relevant personnel are on standby and the public should be on guard for possible effects of the storm. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.

A simple breath test that could help detect the early stages of stomach cancer has been developed by scientists. The screening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development. By looking for distinctive ‘breath prints’, researchers were also able to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease. Scroll down for video . The breath test discovery is hoped to save thousands of lives. In the study published online in the journal Gut, breath samples were taken from 484 people, including 99 already diagnosed with stomach cancer. The test is so accurate it could detect the difference between early and late stage gastric cancers. It might also one day lead to a treatment which stops tumours growing. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, with 40,000 diagnosed in Britain every year. Current tests only identify whether a tumour is likely to be present. Professor Franceschi said that if further research proves positive, eventually it might lead to a test involving a simple biopsy when the patient first complains of symptoms.

Today they are everyday heroes, New York's finest, but the New York Police Department has had a more chequered past than most would imagine. Bernard Whalen's new book 'The NYPD's First Fifty Years' is a tale of kickbacks, mob violence and secret KKK members. A variety of men led the force through its formative years, 21 in total. The department's first chief of police, William Devery, who held the post from 1898-1901, was known as the king of kickbacks. He was recorded as saying 'I wish that about 40 police captains would die overnight. They are no good.' The officer was later found, shot dead outside a Palermo café. Richard Entright (pictured) failed to even try and remove the KKK from within his own police force .

Carwyn Scott-Howell's death was a tragic accident, according to state prosecutor Pierre Yves Michau . The family of tragic ski boy Carwyn Scott-Howell were expected to bring his body home this weekend as an investigation into his death ruled out negligence as a factor. Carwyn carried on skiing and then ventured into a wooded area. Mr Michau said: ‘The inquiry has found the piste was well signposted. The boy would have been aware that he was leaving the piste. The reason why is not known but it was by error. They said they were enjoying their last ski run together when Carwyn's sister 'lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead'. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky. We had spent the most happy ski holiday together in the French ski resort of Flaine.' The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day. Carwyn, seven,  from Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, plunged 160ft to his death in Flaine, France .

With top spot set to elude Arsenal again, Gazidis says the club will 'keep pushing' Chelsea, but he admitted winning the championship is unlikely. And Gazidis fears Arsenal will find it harder in future just to maintain their perennial place in the top four Champions League qualification places due to a surge in television cash. Aaron Ramsey smashes the ball home in the win over Burnley, Arsenal's eighth victory in a row in the league . Gazidis says the Premier League is 'going to become more competitive which is going to be more challenging for clubs like us.' The Gunners haven't won the league since 2004 and their first eight-game winning run since then has propelled them to second. Earlier setbacks, though, for Arsene Wenger's team helped Chelsea to establish a commanding lead. 'we are not happy but we are going to keep pushing to the end and see how far we can go,' said Gazidis. Ivan Gazidis says he is not happy with second place, and says the club may struggle in the near future .

Outside of that, the highly publicized police shootings in Ferguson and North Charleston bear only mild resemblance. Three of the 10 City Council members are black. Even North Charleston's police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of Scott's shooting. The video of the North Charleston shooting, she said, is vital. Mayor Keith Summey denounced the shooting and said Slager made a "bad decision." Both Summey and the police chief also visited Scott's family. The takeaway: Former Ferguson Mayor Brian Fletcher said the city has influenced others. "They have seen what has happened here in Ferguson. Ferguson: After Brown's death in August, many asked why Wilson didn't have a body camera. The shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels. North Charleston: Slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed Scott. That's in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, Summey said. The takeaway: Not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras. They're also expensive.
